  * Reproduce the functionality of the [http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod libtcod tutorial] in a more modular, object-oriented framework.
    * Be able to print a character to the console with a specified position, color, and background.  This sounds sad, but it will be an excellent first step.
