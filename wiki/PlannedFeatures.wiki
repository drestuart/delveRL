#summary A list of planned features for delve.  Combination TODO list / notepad.

= Plot =

That would be nice.


= Alignment =

The alignment system will be important, and reminiscent of the D&D system.

== Alignments ==

Two axes: L-N-C and G-N-E.

== Altars ==

Altars will be aligned, but not god-specific.  Altars have one of 5 alignments: L, C, G, E, N.  An altar is usable if its alignment matches one of the player's alignments.

= Stats =

Str, Dex, Int for sure.

Con? Wis? Maybe

Probably not Cha, although I could import the haggling code from ligers.



= Movement =

Three movement speeds: Walking (normal), Running, Sneaking

== Walking ==

The default movement mode.  Normal speed and stealth, no penalties.

== Running ==

Faster movement, at the cost of lower stealth and eventual weariness (dependent on Con?).

== Sneaking ==

Slower movement, but better stealth.  How much better?  20%?  Should probably scale with skill instead of being a flat bonus.
